# Module projects 

In this folder, you will find reflections of the different Bootcamp and Module projects that I have completed throughout my apprenticeship. I have included screenshots of the projects and code snippets. Links to the presentations for each of the projects have been included as well as the links to the deployed site (if applicable).

Below you can find the links to each project reflection:

- Jediverse (add link to repo)
- Inventory App (add link to repo)
- Circle Chat (add link to repo)
- Spoonful Blog (add link to repo)

Enjoy!
