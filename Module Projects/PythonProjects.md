# Project 4 - Hackathon: Python Projects 

A high-level overview of the project purpose:

## :memo: Situation

For this project, we were tasked with learning a new programming language and creating a project built using that language. For my programming language I chose Python, as that is the language that my team uses. 

## :pushpin: Task 

The core of this project is to demonstrate understanding of the programming lanuaguage/framework that you have chose to build your project with. 

## :computer: Action 

For this project, I built a series of different Python games:

<li>The first game, called the Star Wars Interactive Quiz, I created using only if conditionals, print statements and some ASCII art. The game can be run on the command line. Every time the user guesses the correct answer, they earn a point. However, each time they guess the wrong answer they don't earn any points. Using a score counter, the program is able to keep track of the user's score.

<br>

<li>The second game in the series, is Rock, Paper, Scissors! In this game you can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors and see if you can beat the computer. This game was written in Python using lists and utilizing the random module to generate a random item from the list each time the user enters their choice. </li>

<br>

<li> The third game in this series, is the Batman Quiz. Similar to the Star Wars quiz, I followed the same steps using if conditionals and print statements to build the questions and answers. I also implemented a counter here, however, instead of tracking the user's score, I instead tracked how many questions the user answered correctly and printed out that number at the end of the quiz.</li>
