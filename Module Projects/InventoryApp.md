# Project 1 - The Inventory App 

A high-level overview of the project purpose:

## :memo: Situation

The Inventory App is a fullstack web application created for Bootcamp Part 2, Week 8 of the Multiverse curriculum. The main concept of the Inventory App is a mock e-commerce app in which the e-commerce company can track the inventory of the items that are listed on the website.

## :pushpin: Task 

- There are a lot of core parts to this project, specifically the <code>public</code> and <code>server</code> files. The <code>public</code> folder houses all of the code for the frontend UI. The <code>server</code> folder houses all of the code for the backend.

- The design for this project was mainly focused on user readability and the backend codebase. We wanted to make sure that all of information that was needed was being fetched properly from the backend. My team and I held sessions in which we delegated each task necessary to complete the project.

## :computer: Action 
<li>My main contributions revolved around the backend development and TDD.</li>

<li>  Backend Development
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
   <li> Express for creating the backend routing and handling of <code>HTTP</code> requests, creating the API, and integrating middleware.
   </li>
   <li> Sequelize/SQLite to set up the relational database using JavaScript objects and methods. SQLite was used to help create the <code>server</code> and seed the database
   </li>
   <li> Jest was used to create the tests needed to make sure that all routes were functional and fetched the data from the DB properly.
   </li>
</ul>
</li>
