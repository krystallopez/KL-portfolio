The Inventory App was one of the first full-stack group projects that I completed as part of my apprenticeship. For this project, myself and my group were tasked with creating a fullstack RESTful CRUD application. In order to complete this project, we had to design wireframes, in order to produce a layout of how we wanted the application to look. 

This project also gave me and my group a taste of what Agile development is as we had to function as if we were a fullstack development team. We particpated in various Agile techniques such as pair programming and code reviews. 

In order to build out this application, we first had to build our backend. My team consisted of myself, and my fellow apprentices: Serkadis Dubale, Lauren Richardson, and Dar-Ci Calhoun. Together, we created a kanban board so that all tasks related to the project could be delegated accordingly.

I, built out the models that were need for the project. Using Express, Sequelize, and SQLite. In using these technologies I was able to define our models, their attributes, as well as their data types. You can see an example of this below:

You may have seen the photo above that shows some of the routes (endpoints) that we created as well. This tasks was completed by my fellow apprentice Serkadis Dubale. Lauren Richardson created our front end, of which I have included a photo below:

The front end was created using React, along with HTML and CSS for styling. Dar-Ci Calhoun, performed all debugging, and we also worked together to write out all of the tests as well. The test were written in order to make sure that our routes were working and pulling the correct information based on the seed data that we had created.
