</p>

<li> The design for this project was mainly focused on user readibility and executing CI/CD properly. We wanted to make sure that our backend architecture fell in line with the vision that we had for the frontend as well. My team and I held weekly meetings where we had planning sessions and delegated each task necessary to complete the project.</li>
