# Project 3 - The Spoonful Blog
 
 An enhanced breakdown od the projec purpose: 

## :memo: Situation

The Spoonful Blog is a fullstack application created for Module 2 - Deployment, week 5 of the Multiverse Curriculum. The main concept of the Spoonful Blog is to create a fullstack web application that demonstrates profiency in frontend techologies such as React, backend technologies like Express, and successfully deploying an application using GitHub Actions. 

## :pushpin: Task 

<li> There are multiple core parts to this project, specifically the backend architecture and deployment architecture. The backend architecture is housed in the <code>server</code> folder and the CI/CD for deployment are housed in the <code>.github/workflows</code> folder. The frontend, a wonderful addition to project is housed in the <code>public</code> folder. </li>

</p>

<li> The design for this project was mainly focused on user readibility and executing CI/CD properly. We wanted to make sure that our backend architecture fell in line with the vision that we had for the frontend as well. My team and I held weekly meetings where we had planning sessions and delegated each task necessary to complete the project.</li>

## :book: Competencies

### JF 1.5

#### <b>Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software</b>

 Not only did I work independently on the parts that I added to this project but I also effectively collaborated with my team. In order to complete this action, I helped to facilitate weekly meetings not only to discuss project topics but to also to discuss how to begin the SDLC for our project. I would work with my team to assign individual tasks to each member of the group, make sure that they were comfortable with the task, and also offered help should the need arise. I also created a group WebEx space so that we could all effectively communicate with each other.

### JF 1.6

#### Can follow software designs and functional/technical specifications

By reviewing all project requirements, myself and my team were able to break down how this project needed to be completed. By following the guidelines that were laid out for each tier of the project, I was able to complete each component of the project that was assigned to me. In doing so I was not only able to complete my assigned tasks but also assist with other tasks that were assigned to the team. 

### JF 2.1 

#### Can create and analyze artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories

While implementing the code for the backend, i.e defining the models, I thought of ways the user could interact with the application. An example, being that a user could add a post to the site through the use of a form. If a user wanted to share a dish that they had recently, they are able to do so by submitting their photo and text through the use of a form. 


### JF 2.4 

#### Can create simple software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program

I collaborated and took the lead on multiple tasks throughout this project, including the way in which our code was structured. I first started by building out the model for our backend so that we could accurately list all of the data that we needed to. I participated in various sessions that led to the creation of the logic around some of the endpoints as well as creating the logic for the test for each endpoint. I collaborated with my team on how the UI would be designed as well. 

### JF 3.4

#### Can create a logical and maintainable codebase

Throughout this project, I assisted in merging pull requests from various branches that were created for each component of the project. I collaborated and took the lead on multiple tasks that were assigned through the duration of this project as well. Through code reviews, I was able to review code with my team to merge and approve pull requests. By creating brances for specific components of the project, I was able to help maintain readability within the code base.

### JF 3.6 

#### Can implemnet a RESTful API 

In order to complete this task, I followed the software architecture that makes an API RESTful, this includes:

- Having a client-server architecture, in this case, a front end that communicates directly with a backend that is made up of a server and HTTP requests 
- Using multiple endpoints such as GET, POST, PUT, AND DELETE 
- Using middleware to have access to sending requests and receieving responses via HTTP requests 
- Having stateless-client communication 
- Having data represented in the form of JSON 
- Using resource-based data retrieval, For example, '/posys' represents a list of posts, but "/posts/1" represents a specific item.
