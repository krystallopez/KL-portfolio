### Testimonials

During my on-the-job training, I had the opportunity to work and collaborate with a very talented group of engineers and IT professionals. Below are some reflections from my teammates about our time working together. 
<br>

> <p>I work as a Technical Leader with the Thor Tooling team, which Krystal is a member of. I have worked on a number of small items with Krystal over the last 8 months on both the CHIM tool and SLO dashboard. Krystal has always been a fast learner, she asks the right questions to ensure she understands the tasks and is very adaptable. Her focus on customer service is very strong and she is willing to help customers even when she was still very new to the team and the projects we were working on. Krystal is punctual, contactable, and always pleasant to work with. She has made a number of solid contributions to the CHIM project that have helped the Tool to progess and meet our customers needs. I was also impressed with the presentation skills that Krystal showed for her Front-End Module project. I look forward to continuing to work with Krystal in the future. - <b><i> Noel Healy, Technical Leader at Cisco Systems, Inc. </i></b>
