## CHIM (Change & Incident Management)

CHIM (Change & Incident Management) is a project created to build and improve tooling to help teams within Cisco Umbrella with the Incident Management and Change Management Procedures. The goal of CHIM is to facilitate automation around Change and Incident managment in order to help standardize the way teams implement change and incident management procedures by offering a set of tools that are easy to use and simple to integrate into any team's current workflow. 

In CHIM, users can report outages that can occur within the microservices that build Cisco Umbrella. CHIM is used to record outages, incidents, change notices, and deployments. CHIM is also available to users should they want to build off the CHIM API they can do so. There are two APIs that are available in CHIM, the <code>UserApi</code> and the <code>DeploymentApi</code>. 

With the <code>UserApi</code>, a user can leverage the CHIM API for automation tasks, such as intergrating change notice created into build pipelines. Users can gain access to the API using API Tokens with permissions, each API token is associated with the user who requested it. A user can create an API key directly within in CHIM. With the <code>DeploymentApi</code>, a user can create a deployment access key in order to create a new software deployment. This API will allow users to trigger validation of change tickets and create Deploy Artifacts. The <code>DeploymentApi</code> also allows stakeholders to keep track of all deployments that take place in CHIM for each microservice that makes up Cisco Umbrella. 

In CHIM, a user can also post their Retrospectives. Retrospectives are documents that include details of an incident/outage, who created the outage, how the outage was resolved, and what things can be done differently to ensure a similar outage does not happen. Each retropsective will also include an incident overview, a detailed timeline, root causes, the services and customers that were impacted, as well as metrics assocaited with the outage. CHIM records all of this in a more readable manner so that is easily accessible to stakeholders.

### Testimonials

During my on-the-job training, I had the opportunity to work and collaborate with a very talented group of engineers and IT professionals. Below are some reflections from my teammates about our time working together. 
<br>

> <p>I work as a Technical Leader with the Thor Tooling team, which Krystal is a member of. I have worked on a number of small items with Krystal over the last 8 months on both the CHIM tool and SLO dashboard. Krystal has always been a fast learner, she asks the right questions to ensure she understands the tasks and is very adaptable. Her focus on customer service is very strong and she is willing to help customers even when she was still very new to the team and the projects we were working on. Krystal is punctual, contactable, and always pleasant to work with. She has made a number of solid contributions to the CHIM project that have helped the Tool to progess and meet our customers needs. I was also impressed with the presentation skills that Krystal showed for her Front-End Module project. I look forward to continuing to work with Krystal in the future. - <b><i> Noel Healy, Technical Leader at Cisco Systems, Inc. </i></b>
