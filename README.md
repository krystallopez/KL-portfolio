# RISE Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during 15-month apprencticeship (September 2022-December 2023) with the Cisco RISE Apprenticeship Program. Through these projects I have demonstrated my skills to learn quickly and adapt to changes within my environment. I have conquered many challenges along the way and it is a pleasure to share this repository. 

Enjoy!

## Overview 

- <b>Host Company: Cisco Systems Inc.</b>
- <b>Duration: Sep 2022 - Dec 2023 </b>

During my time at Cisco Systems, I delivered value not only through improvements to my team's codebase but also added additional functionality as well. In this time I assisted in implementing a new component to the existing codebase, as well as, working on various user stories, epics, and bug fixes.

## Introduction

Hello there! :wave:, my name is Krystal Lopez! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer Apprentice at Cisco Systems, Inc. Coding has not always been something that I was interested in, but after working in customer service for over 10 years, in 2020 I decided that I needed a serious change of scenery. I started my first bootcamp, Actualize back in May 2021, and it has been quite the journey ever since! I have grown as an engineer ten fold since I started my coding journey. I love coding because everyday there is something new to learn, a new framework to master, new syntax to learn, a new way of writing an algoritm. Plus, coding is all around us! In our TV screens or our video game controllers, in the streetlights that help control traffic, everywhere!. I love coding because it influences the word around us and helps to make the world a better place. 

I enjoy seeing my hard work come to fruition and seeing the impact that it has within my team. I can honestly say that throughout the duration of this apprenticeship, I have truly tested my limits to see how far I could go. I have worked on a team of 3-4 developers and we have built great things together.  I took part in my first major team project, focusing on frontend development as well as backend, fullstack application development, and deployment. At Cisco, I have utilized my skills that I learned not only from Multiverse, but from my previous bootcamp, Actualize as well. These skills have helped to work and collaborate with my teammates as well develop solutions for our internal customers. I have a special interest in fullstack web development, especially front-end design. 


## Testimonials

During my on-the-job training, I had the opportunity to work and collaborate with a very talented group of engineers and IT professionals. Below are some reflections from my teammates about our time working together.

> <p><b>I work as a Technical Leader with the Thor Tooling team, which Krystal is a member of. I have worked on a number of small items with Krystal over the last 8 months on incident management tooling and metric dashboard implentation. Krystal has always been a fast learner, she asks the right questions to ensure she understands the tasks and is very adaptable. Her focus on customer service is very strong and she is willing to help customers even when she was still very new to the team and the projects we were working on. Krystal is punctual, contactable, and always pleasant to work with. She has made a number of solid contributions to the CHIM project that have helped the Tool to progess and meet our customers needs. I was also impressed with the presentation skills that Krystal showed for her Front-End Module project. I look forward to continuing to work ith Krystal in the future.</p>
