# RISE Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during 15-month apprencticeship (September 2022-December 2023) with the Cisco RISE Apprenticeship Program. Through these projects I have demonstrated my skills to learn quickly and adapt to changes within my environment. I have conquered many challenges along the way and it is a pleasure to share this repository. 

Enjoy!

## Overview 

- <b>Host Company: Cisco Systems Inc.</b>
- <b>Duration: Sep 2022 - Dec 2023 </b>

During my time at Cisco Systems, I delivered value not only through improvements to my team's codebase but also added additional functionality as well. In this time I assisted in implementing a new component to the existing codebase, as well as, working on various user stories and big fixes. This README is a brief overview of my contributions to my team and Cisco's services without revealing any proprietary information. 

Due to the sensitive nature and restrictions of the codebases that I helped to maintain, as well security restrictions that are set in place throughout the company, I will avoid using any code snippets and provide brief explanations.

## Introduction

Hello there! :wave:, my name is Krystal Lopez! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer Apprentice at Cisco Systems, Inc. Coding has not always been something that I was interested in, but after working in customer service for over 10 years, in 2020 I decided that I needed a serious change of scenery. I started my first bootcamp, Actualize back in May 2021, and it has been quite the journey ever since! I have grown as an engineer ten fold since I started my coding journey. I love coding because everyday there is something new to learn, a new framework to master, new syntax to learn, a new way of writing an algoritm. Plus, coding is all around us! In our TV screens or our video game controllers, in the streetlights that help control traffic, everywhere!. I love coding because it influences the word around us and helps to make the world a better place. 

I enjoy seeing my hard work come to fruition and seeing the impact that it has within my team. I can honestly say that throughout the duration of this apprenticeship, I have truly tested my limits to see how far I could go. I have worked on a team of 3-4 developers and we have built great things together.  I took part in my first major team project, focusing on frontend development as well as backend, fullstack application development, and deployment. At Cisco, I have utilized my skills that I learned not only from Multiverse, but from my previous bootcamp, Actualize as well. These skills have helped to work and collaborate with my teammates as well develop solutions for our internal customers. I have a special interest in fullstack web development, especially front-end design. 




<!-- Portfolio Introduction:

- Who you are
- Why you do what you do
- The teams you have worked on
- Your areas of interest

add github repos for projects as well 

Take screenshots of previous projects and create readmes displaying who they were made versus adding in the code 

# Each project needs 

- make sure that each project includes the technologies that were used
- visuals (feel free to add screenshots to the readmes if need be)
- summary of all of the technologies that were used 
- department labor swe functions (need to ask David about this one )
- for project readmes, include the job functions that you think you experienced or demonstrated 


You can add some folders about what you have worked on OTJ, ask Diego if you can grab some screenshots of some of the work that I have done and maybe create a document showing what I do on the job. (Possibly a google slide pressentation?)


Also don't forget to create repo for this project # KL-portfolio

Add table of contents

for each individual project, make sure to add information in the readme on how you built the project. for team folder, talk about what you do on your team, may be able to keep everthing in one folder

make sure to talk about the competencies that are specified but the DOL 

# kl-portfolio

Add some acknowledgements here, we can always restructure this as well  -->
