# RISE Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during the 15-month apprenticeship (September 2022-December 2023) with the Cisco RISE Apprenticeship Program. Through these projects, I have demonstrated my skills to learn quickly and adapt to changes within my environment. I have conquered many challenges along the way and it is a pleasure to share this repository. 

Enjoy!

## Overview 

<b>Host Company: Cisco Systems Inc.</b>
<br>
<b>Duration: Sep 2022 - Dec 2023 </b>

During my time at Cisco Systems, I delivered value not only through improvements to my team's codebase but also by adding additional functionality. In this time I assisted in implementing a new component to the existing codebase, as well as, working on various user stories, epics, and bug fixes.

## Introduction

Hello there! :wave: , my name is Krystal Lopez! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer Apprentice at Cisco Systems, Inc. Coding has not always been something I was interested in, but after working in customer service for over 10 years, in 2020 I decided that I needed a serious change of scenery. I started my first boot camp, Actualize back in May 2021, and it has been quite the journey ever since! I have grown as an engineer tenfold since I started my coding journey. I love coding because every day there is something new to learn, a new framework to master, a new syntax to learn, and a new way of writing an algorithm. Plus, coding is all around us! In our TV screens or our video game controllers, in the streetlights that help control traffic, everywhere! I love coding because it influences the world around us and helps to make the world a better place. 

I enjoy seeing my hard work come to fruition and seeing the impact that it has on my team. I can honestly say that throughout this apprenticeship, I have truly tested my limits to see how far I could go. I have worked on a team of 3-4 developers and we have built great things together.  I took part in my first major team project, focusing on frontend development as well as backend, full-stack application development, and deployment. At Cisco, I have utilized the skills that I learned not only from Multiverse but from my previous boot camp, Actualize as well. These skills have helped to work and collaborate with my teammates as well as develop solutions for our internal customers. I have a special interest in fullstack web development, especially front-end design.

## Testimonials

During my on-the-job training, I had the opportunity to work and collaborate with a very talented group of engineers and IT professionals. Below are some reflections from my teammates about our time working together. 
<br>

> <p><b>Krystal is a remarkable software engineer who has impressed me with her fast learning skills and her communication and presentation skills. She has learnt and used various programming languages and frameworks in a short span of time, and she is always eager to learn new technologies and apply them to our projects. Krystal is not only a great coder, but also a great communicator and presenter. She can explain complex technical concepts in a clear and concise manner, using appropriate examples and showcasing her work and achievements. In my opinion, Krystal is a valuable asset to any software engineering team.

> <p><b>I work as a Technical Leader with the Thor Tooling team, which Krystal is a member of. I have worked on several small items with Krystal over the last 8 months on incident management tooling and metric dashboard implementation. Krystal has always been a fast learner, she asks the right questions to ensure she understands the tasks and is very adaptable. Her focus on customer service is very strong and she is willing to help customers even when she is still very new to the team and the projects we are working on. Krystal is punctual, contactable, and always pleasant to work with. She has made several solid contributions to the CHIM project that have helped the Tool to progress and meet our customer's needs. I was also impressed with the presentation skills that Krystal showed for her Front-End Module project. I look forward to continuing to work with Krystal in the future.</p>

> <p><b>Krystal has been a fantastic addition to our team and has shown a hands-on approach from day one, willing to get involved in all technical aspects, from embracing new technologies to fielding questions from other teams out of hours. She has demonstrated a thirst for learning completely independently and has identified areas where she can push her growth and accelerate the benefits she brings to the team.</b></p>

> <p><b>I worked with Krystal on a major project that we were assigned earlier this year and she played a vital role in the success of the release earlier this year. Her contributions to this project were great. She took care of all front-end development and she promptly picked up the requirements understood the backend implementation that was done by myself and completed the work on React for various workflows of the various stages of the project. She has excellent communication skills and is very appreciated by customers and our team. She is a fast learner and a good team player.</b></p>

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Multiverse, specifically, my coaches, David Todd, Kat Law, and Laurie Corrin for their continued support throughout my apprenticeship. They have helped me develop into the engineer that I am today and have provided me with skills that I will carry for a lifetime. I hope that you all continue to provide your expertise to other aspiring engineers and help me start their coding journey! 

I would also like to extend my thanks to Cisco Systems Inc, and the RISE Apprenticeship for employing me and giving me the opportunity of a lifetime. Cisco believed in me and provided me with the tools that I needed to succeed. Every day I can see how much I have improved as a SWE and I reflect on how far I have come, it is truly a dream come true. 

Lastly, I would like to give a special thanks again to Multiverse, for their support throughout this process, but also to Actualize Coding Bootcamp as well. I had taken on Actualize Coding Bootcamp before being hired at Cisco and participating in the RISE Apprenticeship. I graduated two weeks before I got hired and Actualize coached me through every step of the way. I would also like to thank my team, they have been amazing since I joined on and have truly helped me grow and encouraged me to grow every day, they are the most supportive and just amazing team that I have had the pleasure to be a part of.
