# RISE Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during 15-month apprencticeship (September 2022-December 2023) with the Cisco RISE Apprenticeship Program. Through these projects I have demonstrated my skills to learn quickly and adapt to changes within my environment. I have conquered many challenges along the way and it is a pleasure to share this repository. 

Enjoy!

## Overview 

- Host Company: Cisco Systems Inc.
- Duration: Sep 2022 - Dec 2023

During my time at Cisco Systems, I delivered value through not improvements but added functionality to my team's existing codebases. In this time I assisted in implementing a new component to the existing codebase, as well as, working on various epics and big fixes. This README is a brief overview of my contributions to my team and Cisco's services without revealing any proprietary information. 

Due to the sensitive nature and restrictions of the codebases that I helped to maintain, as well security restrictions that are set in place throughout the company, I will avoid using any code snippets and provide brief explanations. 

Here are the links to each section of my portfolio:

<!-- Portfolio Introduction:

- Who you are
- Why you do what you do
- The teams you have worked on
- Your areas of interest

add github repos for projects as well 

Take screenshots of previous projects and create readmes displaying who they were made versus adding in the code 

# Each project needs 

- make sure that each project includes the technologies that were used
- visuals (feel free to add screenshots to the readmes if need be)
- summary of all of the technologies that were used 
- department labor swe functions (need to ask David about this one )
- for project readmes, include the job functions that you think you experienced or demonstrated 


You can add some folders about what you have worked on OTJ, ask Diego if you can grab some screenshots of some of the work that I have done and maybe create a document showing what I do on the job. (Possibly a google slide pressentation?)


Also don't forget to create repo for this project # KL-portfolio

Add table of contents

for each individual project, make sure to add information in the readme on how you built the project. for team folder, talk about what you do on your team, may be able to keep everthing in one folder

make sure to talk about the competencies that are specified but the DOL
